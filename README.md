### Boy Scout Rule

I love open source.  I am not a heavy maintainer of any large libraries, but I really like the boyscout rule.  I contribute to things as I come across issues that I think other people might struggle with.  This may be things that are overlooked by someone who is deep into the library.  I ðŸ’• a good onboarding readme with good example.

### My Digital Garden ðŸŒ±

I practice my coding skills in various code environments like Code Ninja, Hackerearth, LeetCode and last but not least CodeChef. Most of which you will find on my CP profiles i.e  [CodeChef](https://www.codechef.com/users/viswa_621) , [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/dinakarbodapati).

I write about things I am familiar with, things that trip up folks that I mentor, and things that I am learning.  Day to day I make things with **data** using **python** and **javascript**.
